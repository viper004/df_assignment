ALGORITHM

Step 1: Begin the program.

Step 2: Accept the sequence of memory block references from the user.

Step 3: Read the total number of cache lines.

Step 4: Read the associativity value(ways).

Step 5: Compute the number of cache sets using:
	number_of_sets = cache_size / ways

Step 6: Initialize the cache as a collection of sets, where each set contains ways empty slots.

Step 7: Initialize hit counter and miss counter to zero.

Step 8: For each memory block in the given sequence, perform the following operations:

Step 9: Determine the target set index using:
	set_index = block_number mod number_of_sets

Step 10: Check whether the block is already present in the selected set.
	 If present, count it as a cache hit and increment the hit counter.

Step 11: If the block is not found in the set, count it as a cache miss and increment the miss counter.

Step 12: If an empty slot exists in the set, place the block in that slot.

Step 13: If the set is full, do not replace any existing block and leave the cache unchanged.

Step 14: Display the block number, corresponding set index, current set contents, and access status after each reference.

Step 15: After all block references are processed, compute:
	 total_accesses = hits + misses
	 hit_ratio = hits / total_accesses

Step 16: Display the final summary including total accesses, number of hits, number of misses, and hit ratio.

Step 17: End the program.
