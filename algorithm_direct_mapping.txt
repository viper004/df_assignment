ALGORITHM – DIRECT MAPPING CACHE SIMULATION

step 1: Start the program.

step 2: Read the number of cache lines (cache_size).

step 3: Initialize all cache lines as empty.

step 4: Set hits and misses counters to zero.

step 5: Repeatedly read memory block numbers from the user.

step 6: If the block number is -1, terminate the loop.

step 7: If the block number is invalid (less than -1), display an error message and continue.

step 8: Calculate the cache line using the formula:
cache_line = block_number mod cache_size

step 9: If the block is already present in the calculated cache line, record a cache hit.

step 10: If the block is not present, record a cache miss and replace the existing block in that cache line.

step 11: Display the cache contents after each block reference.

step 12: After processing all inputs, calculate the total references and hit ratio.

step 13: Display the simulation summary showing hits, misses, and hit ratio.

step 14: Stop the program.
